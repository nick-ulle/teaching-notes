    "Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is _distributed_ because it can share repositories between different computers. Your computer and any repositories on its hard drive are _local_. Someone else's computer and any repositories they have are _remote_. When you _clone_ a repository, you're copying the repository from a remote computer (typically GitHub) to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a _version control system_ because it keeps track of changes to files. A _commit_ is a bundle of saved changes. Commits are like checkpoints for your files.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you work on a GitHub repository with other people, they might change a file, commit the changes, and then _push_ the commit to GitHub. Your local copy of the file won't change unless you _pull_ the new commit from GitHub. In other words, your local repository can easily get out of sync with the remote repository on GitHub. If you change your local copy of the file and commit the changes, you create a _conflict_. If you try to push the conflicting commit to GitHub, you'll see an error message:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git push\n",
    "\n",
    "To github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git\n",
    " ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)\n",
    "error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git'\n",
    "hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do\n",
    "hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing\n",
    "hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes\n",
    "hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.\n",
    "hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.\n",
    "```\n",
    "When you see an error, __don't panic!__ The error message hints that you should try pulling commits from GitHub before pushing your commit. If you pull commits from GitHub, you might see another error message:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull\n",

    "This is okay! Git tried to automatically fix the conflict by _merging_ your commit with the other person's commit, but couldn't figure out how because both commits changed the same file (`README.md` in the example). An automatic merge will only succeed if the commits being merged changed different files. Otherwise, it's up to you to resolve the conflict manually. If you open the file causing the conflict in a text editor, you'll see something like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's some text that was added to the file in an earlier commit.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Git automatically marked which parts of the file conflict. Changes from your commit are shown between `<<<<<<<` and `=======`. Changes from the other person's commit are shown between `=======` and `>>>>>>>`. All you need to do is edit the file to look the way you want. If you wanted to keep your changes and the other person's changes (the polite thing to do), you could edit the file to look like this:\n",
